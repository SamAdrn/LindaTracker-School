# LindaTracker+
## Keep track of your subscribers using this simple app

In today's world, there are plenty of online services that offer different kinds of subscriptions so certain users can access specific features. However, for large online establishments, it would be difficult to keep track of all those subscribed users using only pen and paper. This is where LindaTracker can be put to good use.

LindaTracker lets you store user information with ease. Simply enter the user's name, birth date, type of subcription, and the number of months they've subscribed for. The rest is all done by LindaTracker.

Furthermore, LindaTracker also understands the various situations that could happen when handling customers. Let's say a customer decides to switch to a lower subscription level to save a bit of money. Although you'd be reluctant to do so, LindaTracker offers the feature to update every single detail of the customer's information. If the customer then decides to just cancel their subscription,  using LindaTracker will also allow you to remove all of their information with a click of a button. You will be sad to see them go, but at least you don't have to go through the hassle of removing them from your database.

Speaking of databases, your customers will always be accessible even after you close the application. LindaTracker saves these information to an ser file that will be opened during startup and saved during shut down.

## Features
- Add new customers along with their information with ease
- Update every single detail of the customer's information at your will
- Remove a customer from the database with a click of a button (not including the confirm window)
- Ensures information is correctly entered to prevent typos and invalid information (after all, we are human)
- Presents all data for viewing purposes along with different sorting categories.

## More about the project

This application was built by beginner programmers as a final project in an Object Oriented Programming II class. It was our first try in taking advantage of **JavaFX**, so the UI may seem a little rough on the edges. 

However, the point of this project was to teach us more about **data structures**, specifically the ArrayList and the LinkedList. Under the `numberlist` package, you can see lists made with purposes to store different things, categorized by primitive types and Object classes. This project also allowed us to learn using the **parallel lists technique**, where we would store different types of information of each specific user in different lists. Then, each user can be accessed by a specific index, which the user would not need to worry about.

Apart from data structures, we also integrated our knowledge on deciding which **sorting algorithm** to use for different purposes, **file handling** for saving and reading data, and the use of **exceptions**, into this project.

## Team
I was directly involved in building this project, and focused mainly on the implementations of storing data along with the help of my teammates. I was also in charge of bulletproofing user entry, creating relevant exceptions to catch different kinds of errors, and documentation (JavaDocs).

Thanks to [Joyce](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joyce-weng-870044211/) for implementing the sorting algorithms into our program and the file handling aspect of the application.

Thanks to [Kyle](https://github.com/Kai0802) for desigining the UI and providing a great user interface that's simple and stylish.

> This project was made during the Winter 2021 quarter at Edmonds College in Washington.
